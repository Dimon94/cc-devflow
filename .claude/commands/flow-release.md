# Flow-Release - 发布管理命令

## 命令格式
```text
/flow-release "REQ_ID"
/flow-release              # Auto-detect from current branch
```

### 参数说明
- **REQ_ID**: 需求编号 (可选，默认从当前 Git 分支或环境变量获取)

### 示例
```text
/flow-release "REQ-123"
/flow-release               # On feature/REQ-123-* branch
```

## 执行流程

### 阶段 1: 前置条件检查 (Entry Gate)

**Execution Flow**:
```
1. Determine requirement ID
   → If REQ_ID provided: Use provided ID
   → Else: Run check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only
   → Parse REQ_ID from JSON output
   → If not found: ERROR "No requirement ID found. Provide REQ_ID or run on feature branch."

2. Validate requirement structure exists
   → Run: check-prerequisites.sh --json
   → Verify: REQ_DIR exists
   → Verify: EXECUTION_LOG.md exists
   → Verify: orchestration_status.json exists
   → If missing: ERROR "Requirement not initialized."

3. Check orchestration status
   → Read: orchestration_status.json
   → Verify: status is "qa_complete" or "release_failed"
   → If wrong phase: ERROR "QA not complete. Run /flow-qa first."

4. Verify QA completion and pass
   → Check: TEST_REPORT.md exists
   → Check: SECURITY_REPORT.md exists
   → If missing: ERROR "QA reports not found. Run /flow-qa first."
   → Parse TEST_REPORT.md for Quality Gate status
   → Parse SECURITY_REPORT.md for Security Gate status
   → If Quality Gate = FAIL: ERROR "Quality gate failed. Fix issues first."
   → If Security Gate = FAIL: ERROR "Security gate failed. Fix critical issues first."

5. Verify Git status
   → Run: git status --porcelain
   → If uncommitted changes: ERROR "Working directory not clean. Commit or stash changes."
   → Run: git branch --show-current
   → Verify: On feature/bugfix branch (not main/master)
   → If on main: ERROR "Cannot release from main branch."

6. Verify branch is pushed to remote
   → Run: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null
   → If no upstream: WARN "Branch not pushed. Push now? (y/n)"
   → If yes: Run git push -u origin ${BRANCH_NAME}

7. Check if PR already exists
   → Run: gh pr list --head ${BRANCH_NAME} --json number,state
   → If PR exists and state=OPEN: WARN "PR already exists (#${number}). Continue? (y/n)"
   → If state=MERGED: ERROR "PR already merged. Cannot release again."

*GATE CHECK: All prerequisite validations passed, QA complete, ready for release*
```

### 阶段 2: 发布计划准备

**Execution Flow**:
```
1. Collect release metadata
   → REQ_ID, TITLE from orchestration_status.json
   → BRANCH_NAME from git branch --show-current
   → Changed files: git diff main...HEAD --name-only
   → Commit count: git rev-list --count main...HEAD
   → Test coverage from TEST_REPORT.md
   → Security status from SECURITY_REPORT.md

2. Load release context
   → Read: PRD.md (user stories, success criteria)
   → Read: EPIC.md (technical scope, DoD)
   → Read: TASKS.md (completed tasks list)
   → Read: TEST_REPORT.md (quality status)
   → Read: SECURITY_REPORT.md (security status)
   → Read: EXECUTION_LOG.md (development timeline)

3. Generate commit summary
   → Run: git log main...HEAD --oneline
   → Categorize commits:
     - feat: Feature additions
     - fix: Bug fixes
     - test: Test additions/changes
     - docs: Documentation updates
     - refactor: Code refactoring
     - chore: Build/tooling changes

4. Update orchestration status
   → Set: status = "release_in_progress"
   → Set: phase = "release"
   → Set: updatedAt = current timestamp
   → Write: orchestration_status.json

5. Log release start
   → Append to EXECUTION_LOG.md:
     "### $(date -Iseconds)
      Release process started
      Branch: ${BRANCH_NAME}
      Commits: ${commit_count}
      Changed files: ${file_count}
      Test coverage: ${coverage}%
      Security status: ${security_gate}
      Agent: release-manager"
```

### 阶段 3: 调用 release-manager Agent

**Agent Invocation**:
```
Task: release-manager agent
Description: Generate release plan and create PR for ${REQ_ID}

Prompt:
  You are managing the release for ${REQ_ID}: ${TITLE}.

  Context:
  - Requirement ID: ${REQ_ID}
  - Title: ${TITLE}
  - Branch: ${BRANCH_NAME}
  - Commits: ${commit_count}
  - Changed Files: ${file_count}
  - Test Coverage: ${coverage}%
  - Quality Gate: ${quality_gate}
  - Security Gate: ${security_gate}

  Available Data:
  - PRD.md: Original requirements and success criteria
  - EPIC.md: Technical scope and implementation details
  - TASKS.md: All completed tasks
  - TEST_REPORT.md: Quality assurance results
  - SECURITY_REPORT.md: Security review results
  - Git history: All commits since branch creation

  Your task:
  1. Run .claude/scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only
     to get requirement paths

  2. Load all release context:
     → Read PRD.md for user stories and success criteria
     → Read EPIC.md for technical scope and DoD
     → Read TASKS.md for completed tasks (verify 100%)
     → Read TEST_REPORT.md for quality evidence
     → Read SECURITY_REPORT.md for security evidence
     → Load git log for commit history

  3. Verify task completion:
     → Run: check-task-status.sh --json
     → Parse: totalTasks, completedTasks, remaining
     → Verify: remaining == 0
     → If remaining > 0: ERROR "Cannot release with incomplete tasks"

  4. Validate Constitution compliance:
     → Run: validate-constitution.sh --type all --severity error --json
     → Parse JSON output
     → Verify: error_count == 0
     → If errors > 0: ERROR "Constitution violations found. Fix before release."

  5. Analyze quality gates:
     → Parse TEST_REPORT.md:
       * Quality Gate status
       * Coverage percentage
       * Critical issues count
     → Parse SECURITY_REPORT.md:
      * Security Gate status
      * CRITICAL issues count
      * HIGH issues count
    → If Quality Gate = FAIL: ERROR "Quality gate failed"
    → If Security Gate = FAIL: ERROR "Security gate failed"
    → If CRITICAL security issues > 0: ERROR "Critical security issues must be fixed"
     → Cross-check delta requirements to ensure quality/security evidence covers all impacted capabilities

  6. Generate PR title and description:
     → Title format: "${REQ_ID}: ${TITLE}"
     → Description includes:
       * Overview (from PRD.md background)
       * Changes summary (categorized commits)
       * User stories implemented (from PRD.md)
       * Technical scope (from EPIC.md)
       * Test coverage (from TEST_REPORT.md)
       * Security status (from SECURITY_REPORT.md)
       * Breaking changes (if any)
       * Migration steps (if needed)

  7. Generate RELEASE_PLAN.md:
     → Executive Summary (status, scope, timeline)
     → Requirements Traceability (PRD → EPIC → Tasks → Code)
     → Quality Evidence (test coverage, DoD completion)
     → Security Evidence (scan results, issues addressed)
     → Release Checklist (pre-merge, post-merge)
     → Rollback Plan (if issues found)
     → Stakeholder Communication (who to notify)

  8. Prepare PR creation command:
     → Generate gh pr create command with:
       * --title: PR title
       * --body: PR description (markdown)
       * --base: main (or target branch)
       * --head: ${BRANCH_NAME}
       * --reviewer: (from .github/CODEOWNERS if exists)

  9. Constitution Final Check:
     → Verify NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION (all tasks complete)
     → Verify NO HARDCODED SECRETS (from security report)
     → Document any deviations with justification

  10. Save RELEASE_PLAN.md to ${REQ_DIR}/RELEASE_PLAN.md

  11. Log event: log_event "${REQ_ID}" "Release plan generated"

  Output:
    - Complete RELEASE_PLAN.md file at ${REQ_DIR}/RELEASE_PLAN.md
    - PR creation command ready for execution

Subagent: release-manager
```

### 阶段 3.5: 更新 CLAUDE.md 技术架构文档

**Purpose**: 记录本次需求引入的重要架构变更和技术决策到 CLAUDE.md（精炼原则性）

**Execution Flow**:
```
1. 检查本次需求是否有架构级变更
   → Read: TECH_DESIGN.md (Section 7.0: Baseline Deviation Check)
   → Extract: "Deviations from Baseline" 表格
   → If deviations exist: 标记为需要更新 CLAUDE.md
   → If no deviations: Skip to Step 7 (no CLAUDE.md update needed)

2. 分析架构变更类型
   → Read: TECH_DESIGN.md (Section 2: Technology Stack)
   → Identify significant changes:
     - **新增基础设施组件**: Redis, Message Queue, CDN
     - **新增架构层**: Caching Layer, API Gateway, Service Mesh
     - **认证/授权机制变更**: JWT → OAuth2, RBAC → ABAC
     - **数据库架构变更**: Single DB → Read Replicas, Sharding
     - **性能优化策略**: Caching, CDN, Load Balancing
   → Ignore minor changes:
     - 新增普通 npm 包
     - 测试工具变更
     - 开发工具变更

3. Read 当前 CLAUDE.md
   → Locate: "## Technical Architecture" section
   → If section missing: ERROR "CLAUDE.md missing tech architecture (should have been added by /flow-tech)"
   → Extract: Current tech stack and architecture notes

4. 生成精炼的架构更新内容 (精炼原则性 - MANDATORY)
   → **Hard Requirements**:
     - **Max 15-20 lines total** for entire section (hard limit)
     - **Bullet points only** (no paragraphs, no prose)
     - **Include versions** for all technologies
     - **No implementation details** (e.g., "User model has fields X, Y, Z")
     - **No verbose explanations** (e.g., "We chose Redis because...")
     - **Only architecture-level changes** (Redis/OAuth2/Replicas, not npm packages)
     - **REQ-ID references** for all new additions (Added: REQ-123)
     - **Core Principles line** at end (≤1 sentence)
   → Template:
     ```markdown
     ## Technical Architecture

     ### Core Stack
     - **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript 5.0
     - **Backend**: Express 4.18 with TypeScript
     - **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
     - **ORM**: Prisma 5.0
     - **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
     - **Validation**: Zod 3.22
     - **Testing**: Jest 29 with supertest

     ### Infrastructure (Added: REQ-123)
     - **Cache**: Redis 7.0 (API response caching, <500ms target)
     - **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

     **Core Principles**: Direct framework usage, no unnecessary abstractions, reuse existing patterns.
     ```

5. 更新 CLAUDE.md (强制验证 - MANDATORY)
   → Backup: Copy current "## Technical Architecture" section
   → Replace: With updated content from Step 4
   → **Mandatory Verifications** (MUST ALL PASS):
     - [ ] Total section length ≤20 lines (including heading)
     - [ ] All bullet points (no paragraphs)
     - [ ] All technologies have versions (e.g., "Redis 7.0", not "Redis")
     - [ ] No implementation details (check for model fields, API paths, etc.)
     - [ ] No verbose explanations (check for "because", "in order to", etc.)
     - [ ] Only architecture-level items (no dev tools, minor packages)
     - [ ] All new items have REQ-ID reference (Added: REQ-123)
     - [ ] "Core Principles" line exists and ≤1 sentence
     - [ ] No redundant content (no repeated information)
   → If any verification fails: ABORT and fix content before committing

6. Commit CLAUDE.md 更新
   → Run: git add CLAUDE.md
   → Run: git commit -m "docs(${REQ_ID}): update technical architecture in CLAUDE.md

   Added architectural changes from ${REQ_ID}:
   ${brief_summary_of_changes}

   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   → Log: "Updated CLAUDE.md with architectural changes from ${REQ_ID}"

7. Log CLAUDE.md 更新状态
   → Append to EXECUTION_LOG.md:
     "### $(date -Iseconds)
      CLAUDE.md updated (or skipped if no significant changes)
      Architectural changes: ${changes_summary or "None"}
      Commit: ${commit_hash or "N/A"}"

**Examples of What to Record**:
| Change Type | Example | Record in CLAUDE.md? | Format |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|--------|
| New infrastructure | Added Redis for caching | ✅ YES | `- **Cache**: Redis 7.0 (API caching, <500ms)` |
| New auth mechanism | Implemented JWT auth | ✅ YES | `- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt` |
| New architecture layer | Added API Gateway | ✅ YES | `- **API Gateway**: Express with rate limiting` |
| Database scaling | Added read replicas | ✅ YES | `- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (primary + 2 replicas)` |
| New npm package | Added lodash | ❌ NO | (Too granular, not architecture-level) |
| Test tool change | Switched to Vitest | ❌ NO | (Development tooling, not architecture) |
| Code refactoring | Refactored utils | ❌ NO | (Implementation detail, not architecture) |

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Recording every dependency: "Added express-validator, joi, zod, class-validator..."
- ❌ Implementation details: "User model has email, password, createdAt fields..."
- ❌ Verbose explanations: "We chose Redis because it's fast and widely used..."
- ✅ Correct format: "- **Cache**: Redis 7.0 (session storage, TTL 15min)"

**Output**:
- CLAUDE.md updated (if significant changes exist, 精炼原则性: ≤20行，architecture-level only)
- Git commit created (if CLAUDE.md updated, with REQ-ID reference)
- EXECUTION_LOG.md logged (update status recorded)
```

### 阶段 4: 创建 Pull Request

**Execution Flow**:
```
1. Verify RELEASE_PLAN.md was created
   → Check: RELEASE_PLAN.md exists
   → If missing: ERROR "Release plan generation failed"

2. Parse RELEASE_PLAN.md for PR details
   → Extract: PR title

3. Display PR preview to user
   → Show: PR title
   → Show: PR description (first 20 lines)
   → Show: Changed files count
   → Show: Commits count
   → PROMPT: "Create PR with these details? (y/n/edit)"
   → If edit: Allow user to modify title/body

4. Create PR using gh CLI
   → Run: gh pr create \
       --title "${PR_TITLE}" \
       --body "${PR_BODY}" \
       --base main \
       --head ${BRANCH_NAME}
   → Capture PR number from output
   → If failed: ERROR "PR creation failed. Check gh CLI setup."

5. Add labels to PR (if configured)
   → Run: gh pr edit ${PR_NUMBER} --add-label "cc-devflow,${REQ_ID}"
   → Optional labels: enhancement, bug-fix, security, etc.

6. Request reviewers (if configured)
   → Check: .github/CODEOWNERS exists
   → Run: gh pr edit ${PR_NUMBER} --add-reviewer ${REVIEWERS}
   → If no reviewers configured: Skip

7. Log PR creation
   → Append to EXECUTION_LOG.md:
     "### $(date -Iseconds)
      Pull Request created
      PR Number: #${PR_NUMBER}
      URL: ${PR_URL}
      Base: main ← Head: ${BRANCH_NAME}"
```

### 阶段 6: 发布完成确认 (Exit Gate)

**Exit Gate Validation**:
```
1. Verify RELEASE_PLAN.md was created
   → Check: RELEASE_PLAN.md exists and is complete
   → Verify: Contains all required sections

2. Verify PR was created successfully
   → Check: PR_NUMBER is valid
   → Run: gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --json number,url,state
   → Verify: state == "OPEN"
   → If not open: ERROR "PR creation failed or PR was closed"

3. Verify PR checks are triggered
   → Wait 10 seconds for CI to start
   → Run: gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER}
   → Display: CI status (queued, in_progress, completed)

4. Constitution Final Verification:
   → Verify: All quality gates passed (from reports)
   → Verify: No Constitution violations (from validation)
   → Verify: All tasks completed (from status)
   → Document: Any accepted risks or deviations

5. Update orchestration status
   → Set: status = "release_complete"
   → Set: phase = "released"
   → Set: completedSteps += ["release"]
   → Set: pr_number = ${PR_NUMBER}
   → Set: pr_url = ${PR_URL}
   → Set: updatedAt = current timestamp
   → Write: orchestration_status.json

6. Generate final status summary
   → Total timeline: createdAt → updatedAt
   → Total commits: ${commit_count}
   → Total files changed: ${file_count}
   → Test coverage: ${coverage}%
   → Security status: ${security_gate}

*GATE CHECK: PR created successfully, ready for review and merge*

Run /flow-qa to execute quality assurance.
```

**2. Quality gate failed**
```
ERROR: Quality gate FAILED for REQ-123

Quality Issues:
  - Test coverage: 72% (target: ≥80%)
  - Critical issues: 2

Cannot release with failed quality gate.
Fix issues and re-run /flow-qa, then retry /flow-release.
```

**3. Security gate failed**
```
ERROR: Security gate FAILED for REQ-123

CRITICAL Security Issues (2):
1. HARDCODED API KEY in src/config/api.ts:12
2. SQL INJECTION in src/users/query.ts:45

Fix all CRITICAL issues, re-run /flow-qa, then retry /flow-release.
```

**4. Working directory not clean**
```
ERROR: Working directory not clean

Uncommitted changes:
  M src/auth/login.ts
  ?? src/temp/debug.log

Commit or stash changes before creating PR.
```

**5. PR creation failed**
```
ERROR: Failed to create Pull Request

gh CLI error: GraphQL error: Resource not accessible by integration

Possible causes:
  - gh CLI not authenticated: Run 'gh auth login'
  - Insufficient permissions: Check repo access
  - Branch not pushed: Run 'git push -u origin ${BRANCH_NAME}'

Fix the issue and re-run /flow-release.
```

**6. Constitution violations**
```
⚠️  Constitution violations found:

[error] NO_PARTIAL_IMPLEMENTATION: 2 tasks incomplete
  TASK_023: Documentation pending
  TASK_024: Integration test missing

Cannot release with incomplete tasks.
Complete all tasks and re-run /flow-release.
```

### Recovery

If release fails:
1. Check EXECUTION_LOG.md for detailed error information
2. Review orchestration_status.json for current state
3. Fix identified issues:
   - Quality issues: Re-run /flow-qa after fixes
   - Security issues: Fix CRITICAL, re-run /flow-qa
   - Git issues: Clean working directory, push branch
   - PR issues: Fix gh CLI setup
4. Re-run /flow-release after fixes

  ↓
(Manual)       → Code review and approve PR
  ↓
(Manual)       → Merge PR when approved
```

### Dependency on /flow-qa
This command requires /flow-qa to have been completed:
- TEST_REPORT.md must exist
- SECURITY_REPORT.md must exist
- Quality Gate must be PASS
- Security Gate must be PASS (no CRITICAL issues)
- orchestration_status.json must have status="qa_complete"

### Enables Manual Steps
After successful release command:
- PR is created and ready for review
- Code reviewers can approve PR
- Once approved and CI passes, PR can be merged
- Workflow completes with merge to main branch

## Script Integration

This command uses the unified script infrastructure:

### Scripts Called
```bash
# 1. Get requirement paths
.claude/scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only

# 2. Check task completion status
.claude/scripts/check-task-status.sh --json

# 3. Validate Constitution compliance (final check)
.claude/scripts/validate-constitution.sh --type all --severity error --json

# 4. Log events (via common.sh)
source .claude/scripts/common.sh
log_event "$REQ_ID" "Release process completed"
```

### Agent Called
```text
release-manager agent (research-type)
- Analyzes release readiness
- Generates release plan
- Creates PR description
- Produces RELEASE_PLAN.md
```

### External Tools
```bash
# Git operations
git status --porcelain
git branch --show-current
git diff main...HEAD
git log main...HEAD --oneline
git push -u origin ${BRANCH_NAME}

# GitHub CLI (gh)
gh pr list --head ${BRANCH_NAME}
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..." --base main
gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER}
gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER}
gh pr merge ${PR_NUMBER} --squash
```

## Best Practices

### Before Running
1. Ensure /flow-qa completed successfully (QA PASS)
2. Review TEST_REPORT.md and SECURITY_REPORT.md
3. Ensure all changes committed and pushed
4. Verify on correct feature/bugfix branch
5. Ensure gh CLI is authenticated (gh auth status)

### During Execution
1. Review RELEASE_PLAN.md carefully before PR creation
2. Review PR preview before confirming
3. Verify PR created successfully
4. Monitor CI/CD checks start

### After Running (PR Created)
1. **Monitor CI/CD checks**: gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER}
2. **Respond to code review feedback**
3. **Address any CI failures**
4. **Wait for approval from reviewers**
5. **Merge when approved and CI passes**:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge ${PR_NUMBER} --squash --delete-branch
   ```
6. **Post-merge cleanup**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git branch -D ${BRANCH_NAME}
   ```

### After Merge
1. Verify deployment successful (if auto-deploy enabled)
2. Monitor production logs for issues
3. Update stakeholders on completion
4. Archive requirement documents (if applicable)

### Troubleshooting
1. Check release-manager agent output for plan generation issues
2. Review EXECUTION_LOG.md for detailed steps
3. Verify gh CLI setup: gh auth status, gh repo view
4. Check branch relationship: git log main...HEAD
5. Verify all quality gates passed before retrying

## Advanced Options

### PR Creation Options
```bash
# Skip PR creation, only generate release plan
/flow-release "REQ-123" --plan-only

# Specify custom PR base branch
/flow-release "REQ-123" --base develop

# Add custom labels
/flow-release "REQ-123" --labels "priority-high,security"

# Add reviewers
/flow-release "REQ-123" --reviewers "alice,bob"

# Draft PR (not ready for review)
/flow-release "REQ-123" --draft
```

### Post-PR Commands
```bash
# View PR status
gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER}

# Check CI status
gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER}

# Merge PR (after approval)
gh pr merge ${PR_NUMBER} --squash --delete-branch

# Close PR without merging
gh pr close ${PR_NUMBER}
```

**Note**: This command invokes the release-manager research agent which analyzes release readiness and generates release plan. The agent does not execute code or create PRs directly, only creates the RELEASE_PLAN.md document and prepares PR content. PR creation is executed by the main agent using gh CLI.
