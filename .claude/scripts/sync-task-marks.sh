# Sync task completion marks in TASKS.md
#
# This script helps fix situations where tasks were executed but not marked
# as complete in TASKS.md. It can detect and optionally fix such cases.
#
# Usage: ./sync-task-marks.sh [OPTIONS]
#
# OPTIONS:
#   --dry-run           Show what would be done without making changes
#   --auto-mark         Automatically mark all uncompleted tasks (dangerous!)
#   --help, -h          Show help message
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   ./sync-task-marks.sh --dry-run
#   ./sync-task-marks.sh

set -e

# Parse command line arguments
DRY_RUN=false
AUTO_MARK=false

            AUTO_MARK=true

        --help|-h)
            cat << 'EOF'
Usage: sync-task-marks.sh [OPTIONS]

Sync task completion marks in TASKS.md.

OPTIONS:
  --dry-run           Show what would be done without making changes
  --auto-mark         Automatically mark tasks (use with caution!)
  --help, -h          Show this help message

EXAMPLES:
  # Check status without changes
  ./sync-task-marks.sh --dry-run

  # Interactive mode (default)
  ./sync-task-marks.sh

NOTES:
  - This script helps diagnose when tasks are done but not marked in TASKS.md
  - It lists all uncompleted tasks ([ ] in TASKS.md)
  - You can then manually run mark-task-complete.sh for each task
  - Or use --auto-mark to mark all (not recommended without review)
