---

## Preamble

This Constitution establishes the **immutable architectural DNA** of the CC-DevFlow project. It serves as the highest authority governing all development activities, ensuring quality, consistency, security, and maintainability across the entire lifecycle.

**Constitutional Authority**:
1. **Supreme Priority**: Constitutional principles override all other rules and conventions
2. **Inviolable**: No agent, process, or individual may violate constitutional principles
3. **Persistent**: The Constitution remains effective throughout the project lifecycle
4. **Universal**: Applies to all requirements, all stages, all agents

---

## Article I: Quality First (质量至上)

**Principle**: Quality is the non-negotiable baseline.

### I.1 Complete Implementation Mandate

```yaml
NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION:
  Prohibition: Any form of partial implementation or placeholder code
  Requirement: Complete implementation or no implementation
  Examples:
    ❌ Forbidden: "// TODO: Implement this later"
    ❌ Forbidden: "// Simplified for now, will complete in v2"
    ✅ Required: Fully functional, production-ready code
```

### I.2 Testing Mandate

```yaml
MANDATORY TEST COVERAGE:
  Rule: Every function must have corresponding tests
  Coverage Threshold: ≥80%
  Test Types: Unit, Integration, Contract, E2E (as appropriate)
  Verification: Tests must fail first (TDD), then pass
```

### I.3 No Simplification Clause

```text
"This is simplified for now, complete implementation would..."
↑ CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION - Immediate rejection
```

### I.4 Quality Gates

All code must pass:
- [ ] Type checking (TypeScript, Python type hints, etc.)
- [ ] Linting (ESLint, Pylint, etc.)
- [ ] Security scanning (no high-severity issues)
- [ ] Build verification
- [ ] Documentation completeness

**Enforcement**: Pre-push guard (`pre-push-guard.sh`)

---

## Article II: Architectural Consistency (架构一致性)

**Principle**: Maintain codebase uniformity and predictability.

### II.1 No Code Duplication

```yaml
REUSE MANDATE:
  Before Writing New Code:
    1. Search existing codebase for similar functionality
    2. Use Read/Grep/Glob tools to find reusable functions
    3. Prefer function call over copy-paste

  Violation Examples:
    ❌ Copying validation logic across files
    ❌ Duplicate database connection code
    ❌ Repeated error handling patterns
```

### II.2 Consistent Naming

```yaml
NAMING CONSISTENCY:
  Requirement: Follow existing codebase naming patterns
  Process:
    1. Read existing files before naming new entities
    2. Match verb-noun patterns (getUserById, createOrder)
    3. Match case conventions (camelCase, snake_case)

  Tools: Use Grep to find naming patterns in codebase
```

### II.3 Anti-Over-Engineering

```yaml
SIMPLICITY MANDATE:
  Prohibited Patterns:
    ❌ BaseController, AbstractService, GenericRepository
    ❌ Factory patterns for simple object creation
    ❌ Middleware layers with single responsibility
    ❌ "Future-proofing" abstractions

  Required Approach:
    ✅ Direct framework usage (Express, FastAPI, Flask)
    ✅ Solve current problem with simplest solution
    ✅ Refactor when actual need emerges
```

### II.4 Single Responsibility

```yaml
MODULE COHESION:
  Rule: Each module/class/function has ONE reason to change
  File Size Limit: ≤500 lines per file
  Function Length Limit: ≤50 lines per function

  Violation Indicators:
    - File has multiple unrelated imports
    - Function has multiple if-else branches for different concerns
    - Class name contains "And" or "Manager" or "Helper"
```

**Enforcement**: Phase -1 Anti-Abstraction Gate (EPIC_TEMPLATE.md)

---

## Article III: Security First (安全优先)

**Principle**: Security is foundational, not an afterthought.

### III.1 No Hardcoded Secrets

```yaml
SECRET MANAGEMENT:
  Prohibited:
    ❌ API_KEY = "sk-abc123..." in source code
    ❌ PASSWORD = "admin123" in config files
    ❌ JWT_SECRET embedded in code

  Required:
    ✅ Environment variables (.env files, not committed)
    ✅ Secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
    ✅ Configuration injection at runtime

  Detection: Pre-push guard scans for secret patterns
```

### III.2 Input Validation

```yaml
VALIDATION MANDATE:
  Rule: All external inputs must be validated BEFORE processing
  Scope:
    - User inputs (forms, API requests)
    - File uploads
    - Database query results (防止 SQL injection)
    - Environment variables

  Validation Types:
    - Type checking
    - Range validation
    - Format validation (regex)
    - Sanitization (XSS prevention)
```

### III.3 Principle of Least Privilege

```yaml
PERMISSION CONTROL:
  Default: Deny all, explicitly allow needed permissions
  File Permissions: Minimal necessary (no 777)
  Database Access: Read-only when possible
  API Scopes: Request minimum required scopes
```

### III.4 Secure by Default

```yaml
DEFAULT SECURITY:
  Examples:
    ✅ HTTPS by default, not HTTP
    ✅ CORS with explicit origin whitelist
    ✅ Authentication required unless explicitly public
    ✅ Rate limiting enabled by default
```

**Enforcement**: Security-reviewer agent + pre-push security scan

---

## Article IV: Performance Accountability (性能责任)

**Principle**: Performance is user experience; proactive optimization required.

### IV.1 No Resource Leaks

```yaml
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
  Mandatory Cleanup:
    - Database connections (use connection pooling)
    - File handles (use with/try-finally)
    - Event listeners (removeEventListener)
    - Timers (clearTimeout, clearInterval)
    - HTTP connections (connection.close())

  Pattern:
    try:
        resource = acquire_resource()
        use_resource(resource)
    finally:
        resource.close()  # MUST execute
```

### IV.2 Algorithm Efficiency

```yaml
COMPLEXITY AWARENESS:
  Before Implementation:
    - Choose appropriate data structure (Array vs Set vs Map)
    - Avoid O(n²) when O(n) exists
    - Use binary search for sorted data

  Review Triggers:
    - Nested loops over same dataset
    - Repeated database queries in loops
    - Full table scans
```

### IV.3 Lazy Loading

```yaml
ON-DEMAND LOADING:
  Apply To:
    - Large datasets (pagination)
    - Heavy dependencies (dynamic import)
    - Images/media (lazy loading)
    - Database records (streaming)

  Example:
    ❌ loadAllUsers()  # Loads 1M users into memory
    ✅ getUsersPaginated(page, limit)  # Loads 50 at a time
```

### IV.4 Caching Strategy

```yaml
INTELLIGENT CACHING:
  When to Cache:
    ✅ Expensive computations with stable inputs
    ✅ External API responses with TTL
    ✅ Database query results (with invalidation)

  When NOT to Cache:
    ❌ User-specific sensitive data
    ❌ Real-time data requirements
    ❌ Infrequently accessed data
```

**Enforcement**: Performance profiling in QA stage

---

## Article V: Maintainability (可维护性)

**Principle**: Code must be understandable, modifiable, and extensible.

### V.1 No Dead Code

```yaml
CODE HYGIENE:
  Rule: Use it or delete it, no middle ground

  Dead Code Patterns:
    ❌ Commented-out code blocks
    ❌ Unused imports
    ❌ Unreachable branches (if false:)
    ❌ Functions with no callers

  Tools: Use IDE "Find Usages" before writing new code
```

### V.2 Separation of Concerns

```yaml
CLEAR BOUNDARIES:
  Prohibited Mixing:
    ❌ Validation logic inside API handlers
    ❌ Database queries inside UI components
    ❌ Business logic in presentation layer

  Required Separation:
    ✅ Models (data structure)
    ✅ Services (business logic)
    ✅ Controllers (request handling)
    ✅ Views (presentation)
```

### V.3 Documentation

```yaml
DOCUMENTATION MANDATE:
  Required Documentation:
    - Complex algorithms (why this approach)
    - Business logic (domain rules)
    - Public APIs (parameters, return types, examples)
    - Configuration options

  Format:
    - Inline comments for WHY, not WHAT
    - Docstrings for public functions
    - README for modules
```

### V.4 File Size Limits

```yaml
SIZE CONSTRAINTS:
  Single File: ≤500 lines (including comments)
  Single Function: ≤50 lines

  Violation Response:
    - Extract functions/classes to separate files
    - Split by responsibility
    - Use modules for grouping
```

**Enforcement**: Linting rules + code review

---

## Article VI: Test-First Development (测试优先开发)

**Principle**: Tests define behavior; implementation makes tests pass.

### VI.1 TDD Mandate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

```yaml
STRICT TDD SEQUENCE:
  Phase 2: Write Tests FIRST ⚠️
    - Contract tests
    - Integration tests
    - E2E tests
    - Unit tests

  TEST VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT:
    → All tests MUST fail initially
    → If test passes immediately → ERROR (invalid test)

  Phase 3: Write Implementation
    → Goal: Make tests pass
    → Refactor while keeping tests green
```

### VI.2 Test Independence

```yaml
INDEPENDENT TESTS:
  Rule: Each test must run in isolation

  Prohibited:
    ❌ Tests depending on execution order
    ❌ Shared mutable state between tests
    ❌ Tests modifying global variables

  Required:
    ✅ Setup before each test
    ✅ Teardown after each test
    ✅ Mock external dependencies
```

### VI.3 Meaningful Tests

```yaml
TEST QUALITY:
  Prohibited "Cheater Tests":
    ❌ assert True  # Always passes
    ❌ assert result is not None  # Too weak
    ❌ Mock everything, test nothing

  Required:
    ✅ Test actual behavior, not implementation
    ✅ Use realistic test data
    ✅ Verify error cases, not just happy path
```

**Enforcement**: TEST VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT in TASKS.md

---

## Article VII: Simplicity Gate (简单性闸门)

**Principle**: Default to simplicity; complexity requires justification.

### VII.1 Project Count Limit

```yaml
MAXIMUM 3 PROJECTS/MODULES:
  Rule: Use ≤3 distinct projects/services

  If >3 needed:
    → Must fill Complexity Tracking table in EPIC.md
    → Justify why simpler alternative insufficient
    → Document mitigation strategy
```

### VII.2 No Future-Proofing

```yaml
YAGNI ENFORCEMENT:
  Prohibited:
    ❌ "Reserved interfaces" for future features
    ❌ "Extension points" with no current use
    ❌ "Generic framework" when specific solution exists
    ❌ "Will need this later" abstractions

  Required:
    ✅ Implement ONLY what current requirement needs
    ✅ Refactor when new requirement emerges
```

**Enforcement**: Phase -1 Simplicity Gate in EPIC_TEMPLATE.md

---

## Article VIII: Anti-Abstraction (反抽象)

**Principle**: Trust frameworks; avoid unnecessary wrapping.

### VIII.1 Direct Framework Usage

```yaml
FRAMEWORK TRUST:
  Prohibited Wrappers:
    ❌ BaseController extending Express/FastAPI
    ❌ DatabaseService wrapping ORM
    ❌ CacheManager wrapping Redis client

  Required:
    ✅ Use Express/FastAPI/Flask directly
    ✅ Use ORM (Prisma/SQLAlchemy) directly
    ✅ Use libraries as intended
```

### VIII.2 Single Model Representation

```yaml
ONE ENTITY, ONE REPRESENTATION:
  Prohibited:
    ❌ UserDTO → User Entity → UserViewModel
    ❌ Multiple mappings between layers

  Required:
    ✅ One User model used across layers
    ✅ Add fields as needed, don't transform
```

**Enforcement**: Phase -1 Anti-Abstraction Gate in EPIC_TEMPLATE.md

---

## Article IX: Integration-First Testing (集成优先测试)

**Principle**: Test with real environments, not mocks.

### IX.1 Contract-First

```yaml
CONTRACT DEFINITION:
  Sequence:
    1. Define API contracts BEFORE implementation
    2. Write contract tests in Phase 2
    3. Implement to satisfy contracts in Phase 3

  Tools:
    - OpenAPI specifications
    - GraphQL schemas
    - gRPC proto files
```

### IX.2 Real Environment Testing

```yaml
INTEGRATION TESTING:
  Preferred:
    ✅ Real database (use Docker for local)
    ✅ Real message queue
    ✅ Real cache (Redis)

  Avoid:
    ❌ Mocking database layer
    ❌ In-memory substitutes (unless testing speed critical)
```

**Enforcement**: Phase -1 Integration-First Gate in EPIC_TEMPLATE.md

---

## Article X: Requirement Boundary (需求边界)

**Principle**: Implement what's requested, nothing more.

### X.1 Forced Clarification

```yaml
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] MANDATE:
  Rule: Mark ALL ambiguities explicitly

  Prohibited:
    ❌ Guessing user intent
    ❌ Adding "helpful" features not requested
    ❌ Assuming technical details

  Required:
    ✅ Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
    ✅ Wait for user clarification
    ✅ Document assumptions made
```

### X.2 No Speculative Features

```yaml
ANTI-EXPANSION:
  Prohibited Phrases:
    ❌ "May need in the future..."
    ❌ "Should also add..."
    ❌ "Might want to consider..."

  Required:
    ✅ Only implement explicitly requested features
    ✅ Focus on current user stories
```

### X.3 User Story Independence

```yaml
STORY ISOLATION:
  Each User Story Must Have:
    - Explicit priority (P1, P2, P3...)
    - Independent Test criteria
    - Standalone deliverability (can ship as MVP)

  Organization:
    - Tasks organized by user story [US1], [US2], [US3]
    - Each story testable independently
```

**Enforcement**:
- PRD anti-expansion validation checklist (prd-writer agent)
- validate-scope-boundary.sh script

---

## Immutable Constraints

### Workflow Constraints

1. **Standard Flow Mandate**: All development through `/flow-init` → `/flow-prd` → `/flow-epic` → `/flow-dev` → `/flow-qa` → `/flow-release`
2. **No Gate Skipping**: Quality gates (Entry/Exit) cannot be bypassed
3. **Document-Driven**: Important decisions must be documented
4. **Version Control**: All changes through Git

### Agent Behavior Constraints

1. **Main Agent Authority**: Only main agent (Claude) may execute code modifications
2. **Research Agent Role**: Research agents (prd-writer, planner, etc.) only analyze and output documents
3. **Coordination**: Agents must coordinate via `orchestration_status.json`
4. **Error Handling**: Agents must stop and report errors, not ignore

### Technology Choice Constraints

1. **Existing Stack First**: Prefer project's existing technologies
2. **Backward Compatibility**: New features must not break existing functionality
3. **Dependency Evaluation**: New dependencies require justification
4. **Standards Compliance**: Follow industry best practices

---

## Constitutional Violations

### Severity Levels

#### Minor Violations
- **Examples**: Inconsistent code style, missing documentation
- **Consequence**: Immediate correction required, re-review

#### Moderate Violations
- **Examples**: Partial implementation, missing tests, security risks
- **Consequence**: Block commit, mandatory fix

#### Severe Violations
- **Examples**: Hardcoded secrets, resource leaks, architectural destruction
- **Consequence**: Immediate rollback, comprehensive audit

---

## Amendment Process

### Amendment Principles
