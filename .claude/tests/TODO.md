# Testing TODO List

## Active Issues

### Test Environment Isolation Issues

**File**: `.claude/tests/scripts/test_sync_task_marks.sh`

**Status**: PARTIAL PASS (3/7 tests)

**Problem**:
- Tests 4-7 fail due to test environment isolation issues
- The script being tested (`sync-task-marks.sh`) works correctly (verified manually)
- Issue is with test framework's file system state management

**Root Cause**:
- Tests create directories in `$REPO_ROOT/devflow/requirements/REQ-TEST-*`
- Subshell execution context causes directories to be inaccessible
- Test framework's `setup_test()` and `teardown_test()` need enhancement

**Current Workarounds**:
- Using `DEVFLOW_REQ_ID` environment variable (correct approach)
- EXIT trap for cleanup (works but doesn't fix isolation)

**Tests Status**:
- ✅ test_help_message
- ✅ test_no_requirement_id
- ✅ test_requirement_directory_not_found
- ❌ test_tasks_file_not_found (directory not found in subshell)
- ❌ test_all_tasks_completed (directory not found in subshell)
- ❌ test_list_uncompleted_tasks (directory not found in subshell)
- ❌ test_dry_run_shows_commands (directory not found in subshell)

**Solution Needed**:
1. Enhance test framework's environment isolation
2. Add support for per-test working directories
3. Improve subshell context handling for file system operations
4. Consider using mocking strategy instead of real file system

**Priority**: LOW
- Script functionality is verified and working
- Core error handling tests pass
- This is a test infrastructure issue, not a code bug

**Impact**: Minimal
- Doesn't affect production code
- Doesn't block development
- Manual verification confirms script works correctly

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
- Need to study test framework architecture
- Design better isolation strategy
- Implement and verify across all test suites
