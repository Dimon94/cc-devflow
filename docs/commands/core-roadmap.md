# `/core:roadmap` - Generate Product Roadmap

[中文文档](./core-roadmap.zh-CN.md) | [English](./core-roadmap.md)

---

## 📋 Overview

Generate comprehensive product roadmap and requirement priority planning through 6-stage interactive dialogue.

## 🎯 Syntax

```bash
/core:roadmap
```

## 🎬 Use Cases

### ✅ Recommended Scenarios
- Early project product direction planning
- Reorganize requirement priorities
- Present product plan to team

### ❌ Not Recommended Scenarios
- Single requirement development → Use `/flow:init` (then `/flow:spec` → `/flow:dev` → `/flow:verify` → `/flow:release`)

## 🔄 Execution Flow (6-Stage Interactive Dialogue)

```text
Stage 1: Product Vision & Goals
  ├─ Product positioning
  ├─ Core value proposition
  └─ Long-term objectives

Stage 2: Target Users & Pain Points
  ├─ User personas
  ├─ Core pain points
  └─ Use scenarios

Stage 3: Core Feature Planning
  ├─ Feature list
  ├─ Priority ranking
  └─ Feature dependencies

Stage 4: Technical Architecture Design
  ├─ Tech stack selection
  ├─ System architecture
  └─ Technical risk assessment

Stage 5: Milestones & Timeline
  ├─ Quarterly planning (Q1-Q4)
  ├─ Milestone definitions (M1, M2, M3...)
  └─ Requirement allocation to quarters

Stage 6: Success Metrics Definition
  ├─ KPI definition
  ├─ Acceptance criteria
  └─ Monitoring metrics
```
