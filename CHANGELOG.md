# Changelog

All notable changes to cc-devflow will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Mechanized `cc-dev` parallel orchestration with Codex thread tool preflight,
  a fixed child dispatch packet, and read-only child integration audit evidence.
- Added durable execution-environment status semantics to the `cc-plan`
  template and exposed existing `cc-do` helper scripts through skill metadata.

## [4.5.38] - 2026-06-02

### Removed

- Removed the distributed `cc-spec-init` capability and current
  `devflow/specs/` workflow surface.

## [4.5.37] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Required `cc-dev` parallel closeout to audit child worktrees after final
  delivery and remove only known clean, integrated, disposable worktrees.
- Required dirty, ambiguous, or unintegrated child worktrees to be preserved
  and reported instead of force-cleaned.

## [4.5.36] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Moved default PDCA review convergence into `cc-check`, which now runs
  subAgent `cc-review` loops until no P0/P1/P2 finding remains before pass.
- Updated `cc-dev` so the default PDCA path no longer inserts automatic
  `cc-review` stages between `cc-plan`, `cc-do`, and `cc-check`.
- Updated `cc-plan` task templates and examples to record the final
  check-stage review convergence gate instead of default review-only
  environments.

## [4.5.34] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Required Codex parallel orchestration to use real thread and automation tools
  instead of generic subagents, preserving thread IDs for polling, correction,
  and acceptance.

## [4.5.33] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added Parallel PDCA orchestration guidance for spawning isolated execution
  environments, dispatching sibling threads, and integrating verified work.
- Documented the `parallel:<task-name>` task marker and `cc-dev --parallel`
  entrypoint for multi-environment implementation plans.

## [4.5.32] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Tightened `cc-plan` so every plan starts from domain context, repo evidence,
  and requirement grilling before task generation.
- Removed external planning-lane routing and sync language from `cc-plan`;
  unclear project direction now stops instead of routing through another lane.
- Added `cc-plan` reference formats for glossary-only `CONTEXT.md` updates and
  concise ADR creation during confirmed planning decisions.

## [4.5.31] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Replaced the heavy IDCA bug workflow with a lightweight `cc-diagnose` skill
  based on a six-phase diagnose loop: feedback loop, reproduce, hypothesise,
  instrument, fix/regression-test, and cleanup/post-mortem.
- Narrowed `cc-dev` back to planned PDCA work; bug and regression signals now
  route to `cc-diagnose` instead of entering the old `cc-investigate -> cc-do`
  shared-tail workflow.

### Removed

- Removed the distributed `cc-investigate` skill and its root-cause contract
  assets from the public skill pack.

## [4.5.30] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added a shared Domain Context Contract so `cc-plan`, `cc-investigate`,
  `cc-do`, and `cc-review` read relevant `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, and
  ADRs when present, propose user-confirmed context growth, and silently skip
  projects without that context system.
- Added a `cc-plan` Design Pressure contract so non-trivial plans freeze deep module shape, information hiding, caller knowledge, public seams, and vertical task slices before `cc-do`.
- Added a `cc-do` Vertical Red/Green Guard so execution finishes one observable behavior's Red -> Green -> Refactor cycle before starting the next behavior.
- Added a `cc-check` False Green Guard so fresh green output cannot pass unless it proves the changed behavior, bugfix, contract, boundary, migration, or operator workflow.
- Added a `cc-act` Delivery Mode And Release Gate Guard so closeout cannot infer a delivery mode or ship reasonless release gate statuses.
- Added a `cc-review` Finding Proof Contract so findings require source evidence, a violated control, a repair route, and no local report file.
- Added a `cc-pr-review` API Contract Landing Blocker so changed public/API contracts without proof tests cannot route to landing.
- Added a `cc-pr-land` Reviewed Verdict And Main Parity Guard so landing requires explicit review verdicts and command-backed main parity proof.
- Added a `cc-simplify` Confirmed Smell Gate so speculative cleanup is reported without edits and confirmed smells require fresh recheck evidence.
- Added a `cc-spec-init` Overlap Decision Gate so overlapping capability names resolve split/merge/deprecate/keep-separate decisions before durable spec writes.
- Added a `docs-sync` Public Skill Drift Gate so public skill changes scan versions, changelogs, public docs, and migration notes before commit.

## [4.5.29] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Clarified `cc-dev` strict review convergence for PDCA so `cc-plan` contracts are explicitly reviewed and repaired before `cc-do`, matching the IDCA root-cause review gate.
- Clarified `cc-dev` strict review convergence for IDCA so `cc-investigate` root-cause contracts are reviewed and repaired before `cc-do`, matching the PDCA review gate shape.

## [4.5.28] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Clarified `cc-dev` closeout so it routes to `cc-act` for explicit user-selected delivery instead of choosing between local-main merge and remote PR itself.

## [4.5.27] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added `cc-dev` strict review convergence mode so user-requested multi-round/subAgent review gates repeat until no P1/P2-equivalent findings remain before `cc-do` or `cc-check`.
- Added `cc-act` `local-main-merge` delivery mode for explicit local `main` integration with rebase, owning-checkout `--ff-only` merge, containing-commit proof, and no remote push unless separately requested.

### Changed

- Tightened `cc-dev` implementation review loops so product, architecture, scope, or risk tradeoff findings stop through the shared choice protocol instead of bypassing `cc-review` repair selection.

## [4.5.26] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Added `cc-review` hardening specialist lenses for security, observability, release-readiness, and test-strategy risks, with checked/skipped/blocked coverage and residual-risk evidence.
- Added a `cc-review` productization surface facet for demo-to-product readiness, shared action layers, programmatic APIs, agent docs, audit trails, admin/manageability UI, feature flags, idempotency, and operator paths.

### Changed

- Slimmed the `cc-review` main skill entrypoint by moving structural quality and review-chain detail into progressively loaded references.
- Extended the `cc-review` structural quality facet with maintainability guardrails and antislop recovery checks for thin entrypoints, small feature-owned files, pure domain logic, centralized contracts, compatibility-preserving state, CSS ownership, focused tests, and real viewport evidence.
- Added a Hardening Proof Protocol so `cc-review` hardening findings map reviewed surfaces, classify release risk gates, name proof paths, and close with residual risk.
- Extended `cc-review` test-strategy hardening to judge confidence per minute, suite layer/runtime, proof value, and keep/rewrite/delete/quarantine actions.
- Extended `cc-review` hardening output with observability incident questions and a release gate ledger so production readiness findings carry operator questions, safe telemetry shape, gate status, rollback, and watch-path evidence.
- Extended `cc-plan` and `cc-do` with confidence-per-minute TDD gates so plans freeze suite layer, proof value, runtime, fixture/mock boundaries, and low-value tests to avoid before execution can treat Red evidence as valid.
- Extended `cc-check` with the same confidence-per-minute verification gate so green tests must prove the changed behavior before a pass verdict.
- Extended `cc-act` with a release-readiness gate ledger for PR and handoff output, covering local checks, config/env, migrations/data, deploy/health, smoke/cleanup, rollback, and watch items.
- Extended `cc-investigate` with a Regression Proof Contract so bug handoffs freeze failure ownership, suite layer, runtime budget, proof value, fixture/mock boundary, focused suite shape, and low-value tests to avoid before `cc-do` starts.
- Extended `cc-dev` with explicit optional `cc-review` gates so autonomous PDCA/IDCA runs review complex or high-risk plans, investigations, and implementations before continuing, or records concrete low-risk skip reasons.
- Extended `cc-next` Goal Packets with review gate hints so complexity, hardening, test-strategy, and release-risk signals survive handoff into `cc-dev`.
- Extended `cc-pr-review` with PR-scoped hardening and productization facets so remote pre-landing reviews can block or route security, observability, release, test-strategy, API, audit, admin, feature-flag, idempotency, and operator risks.
- Extended `cc-pr-land` with review-gate carry-forward so missing, stale, blocked, failed, or must-fix production facets cannot be merged as generic reviewed PRs.

## [4.5.25] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Added the `task.md#Failure Ledger` review-escape contract so `cc-review` can record process, test, design, and repeatable model-pattern escapes for later `cc-check` classification and `cc-act` postmortem compression.

### Changed


## [4.5.24] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Added the `cc-review` structural quality / code-judo facet for thermo-nuclear maintainability reviews, including stricter approval blockers for avoidable branching, thin wrappers, cast-heavy contracts, wrong-layer logic, and file-size sprawl.
- Added the remaining `complexity-optimizer` report and safety contract to `cc-review`, including default full complexity reports, files-modified status, and optimization behavior-preservation gates.
- Added `cc-dev` worktree-state detection helpers and planning/investigation prechecks so main-checkout work is detected before edits.

### Changed

- Updated skill benchmark budgets and example bindings for the new progressive-disclosure skill versions.

### Fixed

- Required `cc-review` repair-selection responses to show the full 2-3 mutually exclusive options instead of only returning a selected letter.

## [4.5.23] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Added a shared user-choice output protocol for Codex and Claude Code so workflow decisions prefer host-native structured choice UI and use fixed A/B/C text only as fallback.
- Added delivery-mode choice to `cc-act` so local handoff, PR creation, PR update, and post-merge closeout are explicit user choices when not already specified.
- Added candidate choice to `cc-next` so multiple ready next-work items are ranked and presented for user selection before a Goal Packet is produced.

### Changed

- Updated example bindings and sample artifacts for the new skill versions.

## [4.5.22] - 2026-05-20

### Added


### Changed


## [4.5.21] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added adversarial review, hidden-assumption, and surgical-method naming guidance to the planning and investigation contracts.

### Changed

- Updated planning and investigation task templates so generated `task.md` files persist dialogue rounds, release phrases, hidden assumptions, and review findings.

## [4.5.20] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Added Phenomenal, Essential, and Philosophical cognitive layers to non-trivial `cc-review` and `cc-pr-review` chains, with a fixed thought path from phenomenon intake through final output.
- Added three-layer upstream and downstream review-chain contracts to `cc-review` and `cc-pr-review`, including required evidence, diagnosis, and causal-path records for non-trivial findings.
- Added explicit `Default Output` contracts across the core `cc-*` skills so terminal responses use fixed short formats.
- Added `tests/pressure-scenarios/rationalization-library.md` so pressure scenarios share a real excuse-to-guardrail registry.
- Added built-in complexity hotspot review to `cc-review` and `cc-pr-review`, including local scanner/reference copies for nested scans, repeated membership checks, render recomputation, and N+1 database/API patterns without depending on an external skill.
- Registered `managed-skill-sync` as an internal-only skill so publish inventory validation accepts the maintainer workflow without adding it to the public distribution.

### Fixed

- Replaced the pressure-scenario runner's non-portable `head -n -1` extraction with awk-based section parsing so macOS runs show real scenario content.

## [4.5.19] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added checklist-contract references across shipped skills so planning, execution, verification, review, docs sync, and npm release workflows expose explicit pre-exit checklists.

### Changed

- Updated example bindings and public docs for the checklist-contract skill surface.
- Clarified checklist review behavior in `cc-review`, `docs-sync`, and `npm-release` so contract issues are judged before closeout.

## [4.5.18] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Published the mainline release metadata after `4.5.17` was already present on npm, keeping package manifests, changelog, and the release tag aligned to `main`.

## [4.5.17] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Added an explicit `cc-act` postmortem trigger gate through `evaluate-postmortem-trigger.sh`.
- Added `pr-brief.md` postmortem trigger output so closeout records whether an incident postmortem is required.

### Changed

- Updated `cc-act` to require `POSTMORTEM_REQUIRED=yes/no` before declaring closeout complete.
- Updated project postmortem guidance so session-only rework, reroutes, or tool failures can be passed into the gate with `--trigger`.

## [4.5.16] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Updated `cc-plan`, `cc-investigate`, `cc-review`, and `cc-pr-review` to require ASCII branch-chain analysis in their task or review outputs.
- Added plan and investigation task-template fields that trace upstream sources, deepest affected code or prompt/provider layers, downstream impact, and verification seams.
- Clarified that ASCII branch-chain connector tokens stay ASCII while labels, findings, evidence, and explanatory text follow the configured output language.
- Replaced hard-coded English branch-chain templates with shared semantic label tables for English and Chinese outputs.
- Updated runtime output-policy rendering so `zh-CN` configurations describe the policy in Chinese instead of English-only prose.

### Removed

- Removed the `cc-devflow query` runtime surface and the `workflow-context` query.
- Removed workflow-context stage-transition requirements from distributed skills; stages now start from `task.md`, Git, and PR or handoff reality.

## [4.5.14] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Removed legacy process JSON and report-card assumptions from the public workflow contracts.
- Restored the artifact-light `cc-plan` planning dialogue flow inside `task.md` contracts.
- Restored `cc-investigate` root-cause proof, hypothesis, reroute, and feedback-loop guidance without bringing back separate analysis artifacts.
- Restored `cc-do` TDD execution discipline and `cc-check` fresh-evidence verification flow while keeping durable truth limited to `task.md`, Git, PR briefs, and postmortems.
- Restored `cc-review` node-by-node review, risk lanes, finding aggregation, and decision-question flow while routing plan findings into `task.md` and implementation findings through user-selected repair options.

## [4.5.13] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Updated `cc-review` so plan and investigation reviews write findings directly into `task.md`.
- Updated implementation reviews to return repair options and wait for the user's selected fix before editing code.
- Removed all other local `cc-review` output surfaces.

## [4.5.12] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Changed `cc-devflow task-contract` so task document budgets are advisory warnings instead of blocking validation failures.
- Changed `npm run benchmark:skills` so skill entrypoint budgets report advisory failures without failing `npm run verify`.
- Updated `cc-plan` and `cc-investigate` to preserve required task-template fields instead of trimming contract truth to fit token estimates.

### Fixed

- Fixed `task-contract compile` so shorthand task checklists fail before `task-manifest.json` or `change-meta.json` can be generated.
- Added task-template validation to reject incomplete task blocks with `C11` instead of letting default manifest enrichment hide missing contract fields.

## [4.5.11] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added `npm run benchmark:skills` to keep public skill entrypoints under explicit context budgets.

### Changed

- Slimmed the `cc-plan` public entrypoint into a thin harness contract and moved low-frequency planning/review rules behind conditional references.
- Slimmed the `cc-investigate` public entrypoint into a thin root-cause contract and moved low-frequency debug rules behind conditional references.
- Updated `cc-plan` and `cc-investigate` to require CLI-owned machine artifacts: agents write `planning/tasks.md`, then run `cc-devflow task-contract compile` / `validate` for `task-manifest.json` and `change-meta.json`.
- Internalized the new PDCA/IDCA operating principles into the stage skills themselves: assumptions and simplicity in plan/investigate, surgical read-before-write execution in do, fresh intent-focused proof in check, and explicit checkpoint/ship blockers in dev/act.
- Updated `npm run verify` to include `benchmark:skills` after tests, example binding checks, and artifact verification.

## [4.5.10] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added the `workflow-context` typed runtime query as a context index that reports the next PDCA/IDCA skill, current task, source hashes, `mustNotForget` guardrails, default section/JSON refs, trusted commands, fail-closed rules, and machine-readable deep-open triggers.
- Added `cc-devflow query --data-only --no-trace --compact` output controls and `npm run benchmark:workflow-context` for checked-in token estimates plus synthetic routing-correctness cases.
- Added the minimized workflow artifact contract guide, `cc-devflow task-contract validate`, `npm run verify:artifacts`, and `npm run benchmark:artifacts` so change artifacts stay small and measurable.

### Changed

- Updated `cc-plan`, `cc-investigate`, `cc-do`, `cc-check`, `cc-act`, and `cc-dev` so stage transitions start from `cc-devflow query workflow-context --data-only --no-trace --compact` instead of reloading the full loop history by default.
- Updated `cc-plan` and `cc-investigate` so new changes default to `planning/tasks.md` as the only human-authored Markdown handoff: feature plans use `## Contract Summary`, bug investigations use `## Root Cause Contract`, and legacy `planning/design.md` / `planning/analysis.md` remain fallback inputs only.
- Updated `cc-review` so `review/review-ledger.jsonl` is the default durable review record, with `review-findings.json` and rendered Markdown reports created only when needed.
- Updated `cc-check` review truth loading to prefer structured findings and review ledger records before legacy `cc-review-*.md` reports.
- Updated `npm run verify` to include `verify:artifacts` after tests and example binding checks.

## [4.5.9] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added project-level AI postmortem contracts under `devflow/postmortems/`, with `cc-act` writing progressive incident, index, and principle records that include Git evidence and verification facts.

### Changed

- Updated `cc-plan`, `cc-investigate`, and `cc-do` to search project postmortems before freezing plans, finalizing root-cause hypotheses, or executing individual tasks.
- Updated `cc-act` so `post-merge-closeout` must run `cc-devflow archive-change <change-key>` and prove the archive path, instead of leaving archive as an optional next action.
- Updated `cc-next` so unarchived `devflow/changes/<REQ|FIX>-*` directories are next-work candidates, including done-but-unarchived closeout work.

## [4.5.8] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Updated `cc-review` with a risk-lane review swarm profile so broad implementation and PR-landing reviews separate intent/regression, security/privacy, performance/reliability, and contracts/coverage findings before main-thread triage.

## [4.5.7] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Added public `cc-review` as an optional deep review skill that branches between plan-stage and implementation-stage review, builds a stateful review plan, dispatches read-only reviewer subAgents when available, records per-node review ledger entries, checks in-scope code smells, and records Browser/Computer Use plus log evidence when UI or runtime behavior is involved.
- Updated `cc-plan` with an opt-in External Best-Practice Validation gate that records generalized search approval, source trust, repo-fit verdicts, and skip reasons in durable planning artifacts.
- Updated `cc-plan` Decision Question options to require `A/B/C` lettered choices while keeping `D1` / `D2` as question IDs.

## [4.5.6] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Updated `cc-plan` with a fixed Decision Question Protocol so approval gates use numbered questions, recommendations, option tradeoffs, impact, and STOP instead of ad hoc prose.
- Updated `cc-plan` to treat the full `REQ/FIX-<number>-<description>` change key as identity, so repeated numbers from parallel worktrees stay distinct.

### Fixed

- Fixed typed runtime queries and `cc-devflow query` so duplicate local change numbers can be resolved with an explicit `--change-key`.
- Fixed ambiguous query path resolution so duplicate change ids return a structured JSON failure instead of escaping the query registry.

## [4.5.5] - 2026-05-06

### Changed


## [4.5.4] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Fixed typed runtime queries so malformed required artifacts, including invalid
  `task-manifest.json`, return `InvalidQueryArtifactError` with `ok:false`
  instead of reporting a successful query with an embedded error payload.

## [4.5.3] - 2026-04-29

### Skill Strategy Integration

v4.5.3 absorbs the useful strategies from an external skill library into native
cc-devflow contracts, keeping the public workflow cohesive instead of adding
parallel skill surfaces.

### Changed

- Added an external skill strategy audit and migrated the useful patterns into native cc-devflow contracts instead of copying external skill prose.
- Updated `cc-plan` to capture glossary deltas, compare non-trivial interface shapes, mark `AFK` / `HITL` vertical slices, and keep durable handoffs behavior-focused.
- Updated `cc-investigate` to sharpen feedback loops as investigation products and record prevention handoffs after root-cause freeze.
- Updated `cc-do` and `cc-check` to enforce tracer-bullet execution and review test fixture honesty around partial data, casts, stubs, and mocks.
- Updated `cc-simplify` to apply deep-module, deletion-test, and real-seam checks before accepting architecture cleanup findings.
- Updated `cc-act`, `cc-spec-init`, and `docs-sync` to harden issue handoffs, dangerous git action safety, capability language boundaries, and skill contract quality gates.
- Updated `cc-check` to require QA feedback-loop and behavior evidence for bugfix and user-visible behavior verification, including reproduction mode, determinism, expected/actual behavior, and test seam follow-ups.

## [4.5.2] - 2026-04-28

### Skill Review Hardening

v4.5.2 strengthens the verification and cleanup side of the workflow so
review, QA, investigation, release readiness, and pre-ship simplification carry
fresh evidence instead of relying on stale chat context.

### Changed

- Updated `cc-check` to record review freshness, specialist review facets, QA coverage/browser evidence, and runtime failure ownership before a verdict can enter `cc-act`.
- Updated `cc-act` to render a readiness dashboard, check PR body accuracy, and rerun verification on each invocation while keeping ship actions idempotent.
- Updated `cc-investigate` to require a frozen root-cause contract with prior-history checks, boundary probes, backward trace, reference comparison, diagnostic probe cleanup, condition-wait evidence, pattern analysis, sanitized research evidence, and repair-boundary blast-radius fields.
- Updated `cc-simplify` to a Chinese Codex-native cleanup workflow with scope-aware reviewer dispatch, JSONL findings, confidence-gated deduplication, Fix-First decisions, false-positive suppressions, and fresh validation evidence.
- Refreshed public examples and skill binding metadata for `cc-investigate@1.1.4`, `cc-check@1.8.4`, `cc-act@1.6.4`, and `cc-simplify@1.3.0`.

## [4.5.1] - 2026-04-28

### Planning Evidence Gates

clearer evidence, option tradeoffs, rescue behavior, and test obligations before
implementation starts.

### Changed

- Updated `cc-plan` to require named option roles, implementation decision horizon, error/rescue mapping, test framework evidence, coverage quality mapping, and regression-test planning.

### Fixed

- Improved publish validation diagnostics for YAML frontmatter list items that accidentally parse as mappings when they contain `": "`.
- Added a regression test so malformed public-skill string arrays report the exact field, index, actual type, and repair hint.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-04-27

### ✨ Runtime YAML Config

v4.5.0 adds a personal/project YAML config mechanism that resolves output policy
at runtime before durable workflow documents are written.

### Added

- Added `~/.cc-devflow/config.yml`, `<repo>/.cc-devflow/config.yml`, and `<repo>/.cc-devflow/config.local.yml` resolution with deterministic defaults < user < project < local < env < CLI precedence.
- Added strict `output.document_language` validation for `en` and `zh-CN`, with non-standard preferences preserved under advisory `agent_preferences`.
- Added `cc-devflow config init|get|set|resolve|doctor` so users can create, inspect, update, trace, and diagnose the effective output contract.
- Added `config/user-config.template.yml` and `config/schema/cc-devflow-config.schema.json`.

### Changed

- Public workflow skills now resolve config at runtime with `cc-devflow config resolve --format policy` before writing durable Markdown or human-readable metadata.
- `cc-devflow init` and `cc-devflow adapt --platform codex` no longer bake resolved user policy into managed Skill files.

## [4.4.1] - 2026-04-25

### 🔧 Canonical Change Keys + Planning Contract Hardening

v4.4.1 tightens the planning and release workflow contracts so new change
directories use explicit `REQ-*` / `FIX-*` prefixes and executable plans keep
test-first handoffs as a native requirement.

### Added

- Added a public `cc-investigate` skill so bug work can follow `cc-investigate -> cc-do -> cc-check -> cc-act` instead of overloading `cc-plan`.
- Added a distributed maintenance skill `cc-spec-init` for capability-centered spec bootstrap, capability truth maintenance, and `change-meta.json` link repair.
- Added runtime coverage for canonical change-key generation, legacy lowercase directory compatibility, `FIX-*` ids, and rejection of stale `BUG-*` ids.

### Changed

- Documented the workflow as two shared-tail loops: `PDCA` for feature/scope work and `IDCA/DDCA` for root-cause work.
- Updated public distribution, publish validation, and Codex mirror expectations so `cc-investigate` ships with the pack.
- Updated `cc-do` and `cc-check` contracts so they can consume `ANALYSIS.md` handoffs and reroute failed bug fixes back to `cc-investigate`.
- Updated public docs and example bindings so `devflow/specs/` is documented as durable capability truth and `change-meta.json` is documented as durable change truth.
- Updated `cc-plan` and `cc-investigate` so new planning outputs must use `REQ-<number>-<description>` for requirement work and `FIX-<number>-<description>` for bug-fix work.
- Updated public examples to use uppercase `REQ-*` change directories.

### Fixed

- Fixed path resolution so new change directories no longer silently downcase
  `REQ-*` ids into `req-*`.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-04-10

### 🚀 Review-Gated Delivery + Distribution Cleanup

v4.4.0 tightens the requirement runtime contract so planning, dispatch, verify, and release operate on the same execution state, while npm distribution now ships only the public workflow surface.

### Added

- Added richer task manifest metadata, including phase, parallelism, acceptance, verification, evidence, review state, and execution cursor tracking.
- Added native review aggregation in `lib/harness/review.js` so verify/release can block on missing or failed task review proof.
- Added `.claude/skills/docs-sync/` as a maintenance skill for syncing skill versions, skill changelogs, and affected public docs before commit or ship.
- Added `config/distributable-skills.json` so CLI/template distribution uses an explicit public-skill allowlist.

### Changed

- `planner`, `dispatch`, `resume`, and `query` now derive the same ready task and active phase from manifest state instead of guessing from the first pending item.
- `verify` and release-facing outputs now emit explicit verdicts, review summaries, reroute hints, and blocking findings tied to review artifacts.
- Documented the repository rule that changes to shipped skills must update the skill `version`, local `CHANGELOG.md`, and impacted README / CONTRIBUTING / docs content together.
- `cc-devflow init` and npm packaging now distribute only public workflow skills; maintainer-only skills such as `docs-sync` and `npm-release` stay out of the shipped template.

### Benefits

- ✅ Review proof is now a first-class gate instead of tribal process
- ✅ Requirement execution state is resumable and dependency-aware
- ✅ Packaged output exposes a cleaner public surface for npm consumers

## [4.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### ✨ TDD Enforcement + OpenSpec Interop
